## COVID-19 and Vaccination Datasets  

You can access the original **COVID-19 dataset** used in this report here:  
ðŸ”— [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)  

For the purpose of this project, I have split the dataset into two separate datasets:  
- **COVID-19 Dataset**  
- **Vaccination Dataset**  

This was done to enhance clarity and facilitate analysis.
